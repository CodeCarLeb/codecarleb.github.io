CodeCar is an application developped by me [Daniel Awde](https://www.facebook.com/daniel.aoude) and Pascale Nasr, where it gamify learning experience for kids and teach them logic thinking at small age.

We as computer and communication engineering students face at the beginning many if difficulties in learning coding. since we are coping with this type of knowledge for the first time our mission today is to solve this problem from its roots. and the idea came to create an app that teaches this kind of logic to children moreover, a complementary product is a car that can be controlled by the user

Code car is a Free app will be available on google play store

Beta Test CodeCar Android [CodeCar](https://github.com/danielawde9/CodeCar).

When user first install the application, he will sign in using Facebook account

If the user want to change the Language at any time

And select Java

When the user opens up a lesson he will be able to move the car by writing lines of codes of these languages, this way he’ll learn coding while enjoy playing.

As you can see the app give Tips and tricks for each lesson.

There is also free play mode lesson where user can move the car using a joystick. Each time he moves the joystick it display the command use to move the car.

The source of our Income will be generated from.

* Charging Premium service for higher level 

* And Selling the car to those schools as its good way to teach students coding.

* Moreover since I’m a certified trainer I can make Workshops in schools and learning centres.
